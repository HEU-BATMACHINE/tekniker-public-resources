# TEKNIKER Public Resources
This repository contains the source code for an ontology focused on describing the data generated by machinery used in battery manufacturing processes, developed by TEKNIKER. The ontology is defined under the top-level EMMO (European Materials Modelling Ontology).

## Overview
The TEKNIKER Battery Manufacturing Machinery Data Ontology provides a structured representation of the data produced by machinery used in battery manufacturing processes. It aims to standardize terminology, enhance data interoperability, and facilitate semantic reasoning over machinery-generated data.

## Usage
Researchers, engineers, and stakeholders involved in battery manufacturing processes can use this ontology to:

- Standardize terminology for machinery-generated data  
- Integrate heterogeneous data sources  
- Enable semantic search and reasoning over machinery-generated data  
- Facilitate the development of data-driven analytics and decision support systems
